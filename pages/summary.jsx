                        The unnamed Narrator journals about a summer house her
                        husband had rented. Claiming that the house is
                        mysterious, the Narrator mentions that she suffers from
                        a mental illness called Nervous Depression. The Narrator
                        is also frustrated that her husband and doctor, John,
                        misunderstands and underestimates the Narrator&apos;s
                        condition. Forced to reside in the upstairs nursery room
                        of the summer house, the Narrator uses the
                        aforementioned journal to free her mind. However, the
                        Narrator is forbidden from writing.
                        <br />
                        The Narrator feels uneasy about the decoration in the
                        Nursery, stating that the yellow wallpaper is
                        &quot;revolting.&quot;
                        <br />
                        Any attempt made by the Narrator to leave the
                        now-taunting yellow-colored nursery is futile due to
                        John&apos;s persistence. The yellow wallpaper is now
                        taunting and causing the Narrator to rapidly
                        deteriorate. Eventually, the Narrator is overwhelmed by
                        the yellow wallpaper. Now seeing a woman trapped behind
                        the wallpaper, the Narrator believes that she is the
                        woman. John sees the Narrator&apos;s state and collapses
                        into a faint.
